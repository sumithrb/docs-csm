      <description>FAS Recipes and Procedures Use the Firmware Action Service (FAS) to update the firmware on supported hardware devices. Each procedure includes the prerequisites and example recipes required to update the firmware.
When updating an entire system, walk down the device hierarchy component type by component type, starting first with Routers (switches), proceeding to Chassis, and then finally to Nodes. While this is not strictly necessary, it does help eliminate confusion.</description>

      <description>Update Firmware with FAS If FAS has not yet been installed, firmware for NCNs can be updated manually without FAS. See Updating Firmware without FAS.
The Firmware Action Service (FAS) provides an interface for managing firmware versions of Redfish-enabled hardware in the system. FAS interacts with the Hardware State Managers (HSM), device data, and image data in order to update firmware.
Gigabyte nodes that are having issues with ipmitool, Redfish, or flashing firmware may need to be reset to factory defaults.</description>

      <description>Updating BMC Firmware and BIOS for ncn-m001 Retrieve the model name and firmware image required to update an HPE or Gigabyte ncn-m001 node.
 NOTE
 On HPE nodes, the BMC firmware is iLO 5 and BIOS is System ROM. The commands in the procedure must be run on ncn-m001.    Prerequisites Find the model name Get the firmware images Flash the firmware  Flash Gigabyte ncn-m001 Flash HPE ncn-m001    Prerequisites  WARNING: This procedure should not be performed during a CSM install while ncn-m001 is booted as the PIT node using a remote ISO image.</description>

      <description>Updating BMC Firmware and BIOS for NCNs without FAS  NOTE
 On HPE nodes, the BMC firmware is iLO 5 and BIOS is System ROM. The commands in the procedure must be run on ncn-m001. This procedure should only be used if FAS is not available, such as during initial CSM install. In order to update the firmware or BIOS for ncn-m001 itself, see Updating BMC Firmware and BIOS for ncn-m001.</description>

      <description>Upload BMC Recovery Firmware into TFTP Server cray-upload-recovery-images is a utility for uploading the BMC recovery files for ChassisBMCs, NodeBMCs, and RouterBMCs to be served by the cray-tftp service. The tool uses the cray CLI (fas, artifacts) and cray-tftp to download the S3 recovery images (as remembered by FAS), then upload them into the PVC that is used by cray-tftp. cray-upload-recovery-images should be run on every system.
Prerequisites  Cray System Management (CSM) software is installed.</description>

      <description>FAS Admin Procedures Procedures for leveraging the Firmware Action Service (FAS) CLI to manage firmware.
NEW: The FASUpdate.py script can be used to perform default updates to firmware and BIOS.
Topics  Warning for Non-Compute Nodes (NCNs) Declarative vs Imperative FAS Updates Ignore Management Nodes within FAS Excluding Nodes from an Update Override an Image for an Update Check for New Firmware Versions with a Dry-Run Load Firmware from Nexus Load Firmware from RPM or ZIP file   Warning for Non-Compute Nodes (NCNs) NCNs and their BMCs must be locked with the HSM locking API to ensure they are not unintentionally updated by FAS.</description>

      <description>FAS CLI NEW: The FASUpdate.py script can be used to perform default updates to firmware and BIOS.
This section describes the basic capabilities of the Firmware Action Service (FAS) CLI commands. These commands can be used to manage firmware for system hardware supported by FAS. Refer to the prerequisites section before proceeding to any of the sections for the supported operations.
The following CLI operations are described:
 Prerequisites Actions  Execute an action  Procedure   Abort an action  Procedure   Describe an action  Interpreting output Procedure  Get high level summary Get details of action Get details of operation       Snapshots  Create a snapshot  Procedure   List snapshots  Procedure   View snapshots  Procedure     Update a firmware image  Procedure   FAS loader commands  Loader status Load firmware from Nexus Load individual RPM or ZIP into FAS Display results of loader run Delete loader run data    Prerequisites The Cray command line interface (CLI) tool is initialized and configured on the system.</description>

      <description>FAS Filters FAS uses five primary filters for actions and snapshots to determine what operations to create. The filters are listed below:
 Selection Filters - Determine what operations will be created. The following selection filters are available:  stateComponentFilter targetFilter inventoryHardwareFilter  imageFilter   Command Filters - Determine how the operations will be executed. The following command filters are available:  command    All filters are logically connected with AND logic.</description>

      <description>FAS Recipes NEW: The FASUpdate.py script can be used to perform default updates to firmware and BIOS.
NOTE This is a collection of various FAS recipes for performing updates. For step by step directions and commands, see FAS Use Cases.
The following example JSON files are useful to reference when updating specific hardware components. In all of these examples, the overrideDryrun field will be set to false; set them to true to perform a live update.</description>

      <description>FASUpdate Script The FASUpdate Script automates several steps for updating firmware using one of the standard default FAS action recipes.
The script will use an action recipe and monitor the update until all nodes have completed. While waiting for the update to complete, a summary will periodically be outputted.
To update the firmware, first create an authentication token. On most systems, this is created with the following command (ncn-mw#)
export TOKEN=$(curl -s -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \ -d client_id=admin-client -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth \ -o jsonpath=&amp;#39;{.</description>

      <guid>/docs-csm/en-14/operations/firmware/fas_update_ilo5_2.78/</guid>
      <description>Update iLO 5 firmware above v2.78 This procedure is only required if the current version if iLO 5 is below v2.78.
iLO 5 versions above v2.78 are larger than 32MB in size. iLO 5 versions prior to v2.78 will only accept 32MB size binary files. iLO 5 v2.78 removed this restriction. To upgrade to a version after v2.78, iLO 5 must first be update to v2.78.
Find Image Id for iLO 5 version 2.</description>
