      <description>Management Network CAN Setup Access from the customer site to the system over shared networks is known as the Customer Access Network (CAN).
Requirements  Access to switches SHCD  Configuration The CAN configuration is highly dependent on customer requirements and may not meet the specifications below.
To access the HPE Cray EX nodes and services from the customer network, there is minimal configuration needed on the spine switch and the customer switch connected upstream from the spine switch to allow the customer_access_network subnet to be routed to the HPE Cray EX system.</description>

      <description>Management Network Flow Control Settings This page is designed to go over all the flow control settings for Dell/Mellanox systems.
Leaf Switch Node Connections For the node connections to a leaf switch, disable the transmit flowcontrol and enable receive flowcontrol with the following commands:
NOTE: If using a TDS system involving a Hill cabinet, make sure to confirm that no CMM nor CEC components are connected to any leaf switches in your system.</description>

      <description>Management Network Switch Rename Any system moving from Shasta v1.3 to Shasta v1.4 software needs to adjust the hostnames and IP addresses for all switches to match the new standard. There is now a virtual IP address ending in .1 which is used by spine switches. In Shasta v1.3, the first spine switch used the .1 address. In Shasta v1.4, the ordering of the switches has changed with spine switches being grouped first.</description>

      <description>Management Network Access Port Configurations Requirements  Access to switches SHCD  Configuration   This configuration describes the edge port configuration. This configuration is in the NMN/HMN/Mountain-TDS Management Tab of the SHCD.
  Typically, these are ports that are connected to iLOs (BMCs), gateway nodes, or compute nodes/CMM switches.
sw-leaf-001(config)# interface 1/1/35 no shutdown no routing vlan access 4 spanning-tree bpdu-guard spanning-tree port-type admin-edge   This configuration describes the ports that go to the Node Management Network (NMN/VLAN2).</description>

      <description>Management Network ACL Configuration This page describes the purpose of the ACLs and how they are configured.
Requirements  Access to the switches  Aruba Configuration These ACLs are designed to block traffic from the Node Management Network (NMN) to and from the Hardware Management Network (HMN).
These need to be set where the Layer3 interface is located, this will most likely be a VSX pair of switches. These ACLs are required on both switches in the pair.</description>
