      <description>Gateway Testing With the introduction of BiCAN, service APIs are now available on one or more networks depending on who is allowed access to the services and from where. The services are accessed via three different ingress gateways using a token that can be retrieved from Keycloak.
This page describes how to run a set of tests that determine if the gateways are functioning properly. The gateway test will obtain an API token from Keycloak and then use that token to attempt to access a set of service APIs on one or more networks, as defined in the gateway test definition file (gateway-test-defn.</description>

      <description>Network There are several different networks supported by the HPE Cray EX system. The following are the available internal and external networks, as well as the devices that connect to each network:
 Networks external to the system:  Customer Network (Data Center)  ncn-m001 BMC is connected by the customer network switch to the customer management network All NCNs (worker, master, and storage) are connected ClusterStor System Management Unit (SMU) interfaces User Access Nodes (UANs)     System networks:  Customer Network (Data Center)  ncn-m001 BMC is connected by the customer network switch to the customer management network ClusterStor SMU interfaces User Access Nodes (UANs)   Hardware Management Network (HMN)  BMCs for Admin tasks Power distribution units (PDU) Keyboard/video/mouse (KVM)   Node Management Network (NMN)  All NCNs and compute nodes User Access Nodes (UANs)   ClusterStor Management Network  ClusterStor controller management interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, Metadata Management Unit (MMU), and Scalable Storage Unit (SSU))   High-Speed Network (HSN), which connects the following devices:  Kubernetes worker nodes UANs ClusterStor controller data interfaces of all ClusterStor components (SMU, MMU, and SSU) There must be at least two NCNs whose BMCs are on the HMN.</description>

      <description>Access to System Management Services The standard configuration for System Management Services (SMS) is the containerized REST micro-service with a public API. All of the micro-services provide an HTTP interface and are collectively exposed through a single gateway URL. The API gateway for the system is available at a well known URL based on the domain name of the system. It acts as a single HTTPS endpoint for terminating Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the configured certificate authority.</description>

      <description>Connect to the HPE Cray EX Environment The HPE Cray EX Management Network (SMNet) has multiple separate physical and logical links that are used to segregate traffic.
The diagram below shows the available connections from within the SMNet, as well as the connections to the customer network:
There are multiple ways to connect to the HPE Cray EX environment. The various methods are described in the following table:
   Role Description     Administrative External customer network connection to the worker node&amp;rsquo;s hardware management and administrative port   Application node access External customer network connection to an Application Node   Customer Access Network (CAN) Customer connection to the CAN gateway to access the HPE Cray EX CAN    There are also several ways to physically connect to the nodes on the system.</description>

      <title>Create A Configuration Upgrade Plan</title>

      <description>Create a CSM Configuration Upgrade Plan Creating an upgrade plan is unique and dependent on the requirements of the upgrade path. Some release versions of the network configuration require coupled upgrade of software to enable new software functionality, or bug fixes that may add time required to do the full upgrade.
For example, in CSM release 1.2, Aruba and Mellanox switches are being upgraded to newer code.
In this case and cases where configuration changes are extensive, consider taking the generated configurations after review and uploading them to the switches startup config prior to booting to new code to upgrade both configuration and software simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Default Ip Address Ranges</title>

      <description>Default IP Address Ranges The initial installation of the system creates default networks with default settings and with no external exposure. These IP address default ranges ensure that no nodes in the system attempt to use the same IP address as a Kubernetes service or pod, which would result in undefined behavior that is extremely difficult to reproduce or debug.
The following table shows the default IP address ranges:
   Network IP Address Range     Kubernetes service network 10.</description>
