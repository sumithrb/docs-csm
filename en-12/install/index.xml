      <description>Reset root Password on LiveCD It may become desirable to clear the password on the LiveCD.
The root password is preserved within the COW partition at cow:rw/etc/shadow. This is the modified copy of the /etc/shadow file used by the operating system.
If a site/user needs to reset/clear the password for root, they can mount their USB on another machine and remove this file from the COW partition. When next booting from the USB it will reinitialize to an empty password for root, and again at next login it will require the password to be changed.</description>

      <description>Deploy Management Nodes The following procedure deploys Linux and Kubernetes software to the management NCNs. Deployment of the nodes starts with booting the storage nodes followed by the master nodes and worker nodes together.
After the operating system boots on each node, there are some configuration actions which take place. Watching the console or the console log for certain nodes can help to understand what happens and when. When the process completes for all nodes, the Ceph storage is initialized and the Kubernetes cluster is created and ready for a workload.</description>

This process is typically needed when generating the hmn_connections.json file for a new system, or regenerating it when a system&amp;rsquo;s SHCD file is changed (specifically the HMN tab). The hms-shcd-parser tool can be used to generate the hmn_connections.json file.

      <description>Create NCN Metadata CSV The information in the ncn_metadata.csv file identifies each of the management nodes, assigns the function as a master, worker, or storage node, and provides the MAC address information needed to identify the BMC and the NIC which will be used to boot the node.
Some of the data in the ncn_metadata.csv can be found in the SHCD in the HMN tab. However, the hardest data to collect is the MAC addresses for the node&amp;rsquo;s BMC, the node&amp;rsquo;s bootable network interface, and the pair of network interfaces which will become the bonded interface bond0.</description>

      <description>Configure Administrative Access There are several operations which configure administrative access to different parts of the system. Ensuring that the cray CLI can be used with administrative credentials enables use of many management services via commands. The management nodes can be locked from accidental manipulation by the cray capmc and cray fas commands when the intent is to work on the entire system except the management nodes. The cray scsd command can change the SSH keys, NTP server, syslog server, and BMC/controller passwords.</description>

Newer systems have HPE Aruba switches, while older systems have Dell and Mellanox switches. Switch IP addresses are generated by Cray Site Init (CSI).
Documentation for the Management Network can be found in the HPE Cray EX Management Network Installation and Configuration Guide.
The configuration for these switches will be generated from CSM Automated Network Utility (CANU).</description>

      <description>Ceph CSI Troubleshooting If there has been a failure to initialize all Ceph CSI components on ncn-s001, then the storage node cloud-init may need to be rerun.
Topics:  Verify Ceph CSI Rerun Storage Node cloud-init  Details 1. Verify Ceph CSI Verify that the ceph-csi requirements are in place.
  Log in to ncn-s001 and run the following command.
ncn-s001# ceph -s If it returns a connection error, then assume Ceph is not installed.</description>

      <description>Clear Gigabyte CMOS Because of a bug in the Gigabyte firmware, the Shasta 1.5 install may negatively impact Gigabyte motherboards when attempting to boot using bonded Mellanox network cards. The result is a board that is unusable until a CMOS clear is physically done via a jumper on the board itself.
A patched firmware release (newer than C20 BIOS) is expected to be available for a future release of Shasta. It is recommended that Gigabyte users wait for this new firmware before attempting an installation of Shasta 1.</description>

      <description>Collect MAC Addresses for NCNs Now that the PIT node has been booted with the LiveCD and the management network switches have been configured, the actual MAC addresses for the management nodes can be collected. This process will include repetition of some of the steps done up to this point because csi config init will need to be run with the proper MAC addresses and some services will need to be restarted.</description>

      <description>Collecting the BMC MAC Addresses This guide will detail how to collect BMC MAC addresses from an HPE Cray EX system with configured switches. The BMC MAC address is the exclusive, dedicated LAN for the onboard BMC.
Results may vary if an unconfigured switch is being used.
Prerequisites  There is a configured switch with SSH access or unconfigured with COM access (Serial Over LAN/DB-9). A file is available to record the collected BMC information.</description>

      <description>Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD Remote ISO The Pre-Install Toolkit (PIT) node needs to be bootstrapped from the LiveCD. There are two media available to bootstrap the PIT node: the RemoteISO or a bootable USB device. This procedure describes using the USB device. If not using the RemoteISO, see Bootstrap PIT Node from LiveCD USB
The installation process is similar to the USB-based installation, with adjustments to account for the lack of removable storage.</description>
