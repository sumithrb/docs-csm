      <description>CAPMC Deprecation Notice Many CAPMC v1 REST API and CLI features are being deprecated as of CSM version 1.0. Full removal of the following deprecated CAPMC features will happen in a future CSM release. Further development of CAPMC service and CLI has stopped. CAPMC has entered end-of-life but will still be generally available. CAPMC is going to be replaced with the Power Control Service (PCS) in a future release. The current API/CLI portfolio for CAPMC is being pruned to better align with the future direction of PCS.</description>

      <description>Deprecated Features This page lists deprecated features in CSM. They are no longer being actively developed and are planned to be removed in a future CSM release.
When a feature is first deprecated, it may not yet be announced in which CSM version that feature will be fully removed. When such a decision has been made, that information will be available on this page. For any deprecated features listed on this page that do not yet have an announced CSM version for their planned removal, customers are still strongly encouraged to make plans to migrate away from the deprecated feature.</description>
