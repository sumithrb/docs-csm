      <description>Customize an Image Root Using IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) customization workflow sets up a temporary image customization environment within a Kubernetes pod and mounts the image to be customized in that environment. A system administrator then makes the desired changes to the image root within the customization environment.
Afterwards, the IMS customization workflow automatically copies the NCN CA public key to /etc/cray/ca/certificate_authority.crt within the image root being customized, in order to enable secure communications between NCNs and client nodes.</description>

      <description>Delete or Recover Deleted IMS Content The Image Management System (IMS) manages user supplied SSH public Keys, customizable image recipes, images, and IMS jobs that are used to build or customize images. In previous versions of IMS, deleting an IMS public key, recipe, or image resulted in that item being permanently deleted. Additionally, IMS recipes and images store linked artifacts in the Simple Storage Service (S3) datastore. These artifacts are referenced by the IMS recipe and image records.</description>

      <description>Image Management The Image Management Service (IMS) uses the open source Kiwi-NG tool to build image roots from compressed Kiwi image descriptions. These compressed Kiwi image descriptions are referred to as &amp;ldquo;recipes.&amp;rdquo; Kiwi-NG builds images based on a variety of different Linux distributions, specifically SUSE, RHEL, and their derivatives. Kiwi image descriptions must follow the Kiwi development schema. More information about the development schema and the Kiwi-NG tool can be found in the documentation: https://doc.</description>

      <description>Image Management Workflows Overview of how to create an image and how to customize and image.
The following workflows are intended to be high-level overviews of image management tasks. These workflows depict how services interact with each other during image management and help to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.
The workflows in this section include:
 Create a New Image Customize an Image  Create a New Image Use Case: The system administrator creates an image root from a customized recipe.</description>

      <title>Import An External Image To IMS</title>

      <description>Import an External Image to IMS The Image Management Service (IMS) is typically used to build images from IMS recipes and customize Images that are already known to IMS. However, it is sometimes the case that an image is built using a mechanism other than by IMS and needs to be added to IMS. In these cases, the following procedure can be used to add this external image to IMS and upload the image&amp;rsquo;s artifacts to the Simple Storage Service (S3).</description>

      <description>Import an NCN Image to IMS This page documents an automated tool which takes a set of Non-Compute Node (NCN) kernel, initrd, and SquashFS artifact files, uploads them into the Simple Storage Service (S3), and registers them as an image in the Image Management Service (IMS).
For the more general (and more manual) procedure for how to register images in IMS, see Import an External Image to IMS. In addition to providing a more detailed explanation of the various subtasks being carried out, that procedure also covers such variations as:</description>

      <description>Configure IMS to Validate RPMs Configuring the Image Management Service (IMS) to validate the GPG signatures of RPMs during IMS Build operations involves the following two steps:
  Create and update IMS to use a new Kiwi-NG Image with the Signing Keys embedded.
 NOTE The default IMS Kiwi-NG Image is already configured with the signing keys needed to validate HPE and SuSE RPMs and repositories.
   Update IMS Recipes to require GPG verification of RPMs, repositories, or both.</description>
