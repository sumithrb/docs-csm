      <description>Upgrade Compute Nodes with CRUS  NOTE CRUS was deprecated in CSM 1.2.0 and it will be removed in CSM 1.5.0. See the following links for more information:
 Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2 Deprecated features   Upgrade a set of compute nodes with the Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS). Manage the workload management status of nodes and quiesce each node before taking the node out of service and upgrading it.</description>

      <description>Compute Rolling Upgrades  NOTE CRUS was deprecated in CSM 1.2.0 and it will be removed in CSM 1.5.0. See the following links for more information:
 Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2 Deprecated features   The Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) upgrades sets of compute nodes without requiring an entire set of nodes to be out of service at once. CRUS manages the workload management status of nodes, handling each of the following steps required to upgrade compute nodes:</description>

      <description>CRUS Workflow  NOTE CRUS was deprecated in CSM 1.2.0 and it will be removed in CSM 1.5.0. See the following links for more information:
 Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2 Deprecated features   The following workflow is intended to be a high-level overview of how to upgrade compute nodes. This workflow depicts how services interact with each other during the compute node upgrade process, and helps to provide a quicker and deeper understanding of how the system functions.</description>

      <description>Troubleshoot a Failed CRUS Session Because of Bad Parameters  NOTE CRUS was deprecated in CSM 1.2.0 and it will be removed in CSM 1.5.0. See the following links for more information:
 Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2 Deprecated features   A CRUS session must be deleted and recreated if it does not start or complete because of parameters having incorrect values.
The following are examples of incorrect parameters:</description>

 Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2 Deprecated features   If a CRUS session has any unmet conditions, adding or fixing them will cause the session to continue from wherever it got stuck. Updating other parts of the system to meet the required conditions of a CRUS session will unblock the upgrade session.</description>

 Rolling Upgrades with BOS V2 Deprecated features   Troubleshoot compute nodes failing to upgrade during a Compute Rolling Upgrade Service (CRUS) session and rerun the session on the failed nodes.
When nodes are marked as failed they are added to the failed node group associated with the upgrade session, and the nodes are marked as down in the workload manager (WLM).</description>
